### Composite Pantakar-Euler method

This repository has as aim to dissect the ideas from the article **"Composite Pantakar-Euler methods for positive simulations of stochastic differential equation models for biological regulatory systems"** from Aimin Chen. This article proposes a study on differential equations for modeling processes that don't admit negative solutions, using the numerical analysis on biological systems. The algorithm is simple ...
